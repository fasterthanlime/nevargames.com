    <h2>Hi there!</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Nice to meet you! Here, I'm trying to list a few things I do. Most of it has to do with either programming, music, or entrepreneurship.</p>

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>I've been working at <a href="http://official.fm">Official.fm</a> since March 2011. We are a growing start-up with offices in Geneva, New York and San Francisco, looking to provide solutions to music professionals (artists, indie labels) in order to optimize their day-to-day.</p>

    <h3>Compilers</h3>
    <p>In 2009, I started creating a programming language called ooc. In the start inspired by Java but without the dumb, it ended up with more features than I expected, and as a result, the toolchain is sometimes less reliable then we wish it was. However I still haven't found a prettier language. After all, beauty <strong>is</strong> in the eye of the beholder.</p>

    <h3>Games</h3>
    <p>As a kid, I messed around a lot with game creation software from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickteam">Clickteam</a>: first The Games Factory, then Multimedia Fusion. I spent my high school years prototyping dozens of games, never finishing any, while writing music samples in Cakewalk 3.</p>

    <h3>Studies</h3>
    <p>In 2008 I started a Bachelor in micro-engineering at <a href="http://epfl.ch">EPFL</a>, Switzerland. Fortunately, it took me only one year to realize I wanted to study Computer Science instead. I've been working towards obtaining a master in CS ever since, on top of my job and demanding hobbies.</p>

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>I have been playing the piano for as long as I can remember. My favorite classical composers are Chopin, Rachmaninoff, and Liszt. Recently I've started a band with two friends where I sing and occasionally play the guitar and piano. We have no big releases as of yet!</p>
