### Behind NevarGames

NevarGames is a game creation collective composed of three persons from Switzerland, France,
and Israel.

We've done a few [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nddrylliog) entries together.
And we want to take it a notch further!

In particular, we're in for [OneGameAMonth](http://onegameamonth.com).

Meet the team!

### Einat Schlagmann

[Einat](https://twitter.com/eschlagmann) is a talented 2D artist, musician, and coder living in Israel.

When she's not busy drawing dragons for our games, she works on contracts
as an illustrator. If you have work that needs to be done, feel free
to [ping her](https://twitter.com/eschlagmann)!

</div>

[Sylvain](https://twitter.com/bigsylvain) is a [musician](https://soundcloud.com/bigsylvain) at heart,
never too far from a piano. He also likes to draw and, sometimes, code
a little bit.

Of course, most of the time, he's dreaming up some new game mechanics for
one of our games. The rest of the time, he studies maths at ETHZ.

### Amos Wenger

</div>

Amos [mostly hacks](http://amos.me/), at least when he doesn't try to pretend he can draw.
He has been seen playing the piano then and now.

When he's not doing contract work for various clients, he's trying really hard
to get expelled from EPFL or, failing that, to get a Bachelor in Computer Science.
